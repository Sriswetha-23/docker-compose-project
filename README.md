This project is a simple microservices-based application built using Docker Compose. 


It contains two services running in separate containers.


The first service is a Python Flask REST API that returns a list of fruits in JSON format.


The second service is a PHP web application running on Apache. It consumes the Flask API and displays the fruit list in the browser.
